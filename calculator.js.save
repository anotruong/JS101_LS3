Given a pair of numbers.

Iterate once.
-create new varable, result, that adds two numbers together. 
return result

START

SET RESULT  = number1 + number2
PRINT RESULT;

-interate once
-while looping through the array.length as the counter
	-let the result be the first string added to the next. 
	-print a string.concat. 
START

SET ITERATOR = 1

WHILE ITERATOR <= ARRAY.LENGTH
	SET RESULT = first element added to the next element and so on.

	iterator = iterator + 1
PRINT RESULT


-interate once.
- for loop over the array.length
	-if array[i] % === 1
		-return that array
	-otherwise 
		-continue. 
START

ITERATOR = 1
SET RESULT = EMPTY ARRAY

FOR ARRAY.LENGTH
	IF THE INDEX IS AN ODD NUMBER
		PUSHTHAT ELEMENT INTO RESULT
	OTHERWISE
		CONTINUE;

PRINT RESULT.


a function that returns the sum of two numbers
a function that takes an array of strings, and returns a string that is
 all those strings concatenated together
a function that takes an array of integers, and returns a new array
 with every other element
